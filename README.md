What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was attempting to develop code that would allow a user to upload a course list and then sort it. Overall i was learnign to apply data structures in the course.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approach the problems by wactching videos to see how they are applied by people working in the industry. After taking this course i see how data structures are important due to allowing developers to create code that can perform as a higher efficiency than the code i was making before. The overall code seems less redundant.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I had a lot of roadblocks when it came to this course the biggest being how different people structure nodes compared to various videos and the course reading. It was hard to find which style i prefer and if that style was allowed when turning work in.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project i think my view of user pseduocode has changed. Prior to this project most of the code i have done was simple enough i didn't need it. Also the fact that i've been exposed to data structures in hindsight a lot of the prior course work had easier solutions.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I think overall as i code more my code is becoming more maintainable. I think i'm a fairly new programmer and i lack confidence but being given course work like this project really make one think of ways to become better. I also could have overlooked it but in this project there was now starter code so i was initally lost and had to look at what needed to be included and the correct ways to implement them.
